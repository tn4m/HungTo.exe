If you want to run this yourself, you first need to download the file "globalKeyboardHook.cs" from https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19004/A-Simple-C-Global-Low-Level-Keyboard-Hook. Since the file is licensed under the CPOL v2.0, it is not compatible with the GNU GPL v3.0 (source: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#cpol). If you want to build this yourself, go and grab the file and place it **in the root folder of the project**.
